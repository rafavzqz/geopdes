% OP_GRADVN_F: assemble the right hand-side vector r = [r(i)], r(i) = (epsilon (grad v n)_i, f).
%
%   rhs = op_gradvn_f (spv, msh, coeff);
%
% INPUT:
%
%   spv:   structure representing the space of test functions (see sp_bspline_2d/sp_evaluate_col)
%   msh:   structure containing the domain partition and the quadrature rule for the boundary, 
%           since it must contain the normal vector (see msh_2d/msh_eval_boundary_side)
%   coeff: vector-valued function f, evaluated at the quadrature points
%
% OUTPUT:
%
%   rhs: assembled right-hand side
