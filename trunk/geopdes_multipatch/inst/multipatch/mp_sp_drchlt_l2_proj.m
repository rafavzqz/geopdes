% MP_SP_DRCHLT_L2_PROJ: assign the degrees of freedom of Dirichlet boundaries through an L2 projection, in multipatch geometries.
%
%   [u, dofs] = mp_sp_drchlt_l2_proj (sp, msh, h, gnum, boundaries, refs)
%
% INPUT:
%
%  sp:         object representing the space of trial functions (see sp_bspline_2d)
%  msh:        object containing the domain partition and the quadrature rule (see msh_2d)
%  h:          function handle to compute the Dirichlet condition
%  gnum:       global numbering of the degrees of freedom (see mp_interface_2d)
%  boundaries: array of strcutures containing the information for the boundaries (see mp_geo_load)
%  refs:       boundary references on which a Dirichlet condition is imposed
%
% OUTPUT:
%
%  u:    assigned value to the degrees of freedom
%  dofs: global numbering of the corresponding basis functions
