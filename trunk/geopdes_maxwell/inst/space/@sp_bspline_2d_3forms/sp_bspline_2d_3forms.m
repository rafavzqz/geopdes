%
%        FIELD_NAME      (SIZE)                      DESCRIPTION
%        spu             (struct)                    space of univariate splines in the first parametric direction
%        spv             (struct)                    space of univariate splines in the second parametric direction
%        ndof            (scalar)                    total number of degrees of freedom
%        ndof_dir        (1 x 2 vector)              degrees of freedom along each direction
%        nsh_max         (scalar)                    maximum number of shape functions per element
%        nsh_dir         (1 x 2 vector)              maximum number of univariate shape functions per element in each parametric direction
%        ncomp           (scalar)                    number of components of the functions of the space (actually, 1)
%
%       METHOD_NAME
%       sp_evaluate_col: compute the basis functions in one column of the mesh (that is, fixing the element in the first parametric direction).
%       sp_evaluate_col_param: compute the basis functions in one column of the mesh in the reference domain.
