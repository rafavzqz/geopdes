-----------------------------------------------------

1. INSTALLATION

1.1. OCTAVE

1.1.1 - Install
 
 * Install Octave version 3.2 or higher. Source code is available from
    http://www.octave.org, binary packages for Mac OSX and Windows are
    available from http://octave.sf.net, Linux binary packages are
    included with all major binary distributions.

 * Install the "nurbs" package available on
    http://octave.sf.net: 
   - download the latest release of nurbs-<version>.tar.gz
   - type, at the octave prompt
      pkg install nurbs-<version>.tar.gz
      pkg load nurbs

 * Download the geopdes_base-<version>.tar.gz package from 
    http://geopdes.sf.net/functions/geopdes_base
 
 * Install geopdes_base package by typing at the octave prompt
   pkg install geopdes_base-<version>.tar.gz

 * Load the package:
   pkg load geopdes_base

 * After installing the geopdes_base package, the other packages 
    can be installed in an analogous way.

1.1.3 - Note for Windows users

 * The mingw-based binary version of Octave distributed on
    http://octave.sf.net by default installs dynamically loaded binary
    functions in a different location as that of script functions. This
    can create problems when installing geopdes_base, it is therefore
    recomended that you change the package installation prefix prior to
    installing geopdes_base, e.g.:

    mkdir c:\octave-packages
    pkg prefix c:\octave-packages c:\octave-packages
    system ("tar xzf geopdes_base-<version>.tar.gz")
    pkg install geopdes_base-<version>

   If this procedure fails for you please let us know. See the section
    "HOW TO CONTRIBUTE" below for the preferred procedure for giving
    feedback.

1.2. MATLAB

 * Install the "nurbs" package available on http://octave.sf.net:
   - download the latest release of nurbs.tar.gz available on 
      http://octave.sf.net
   - uncompress and untar the file. We recommend you to do this in the
      toolbox folder of Matlab.
   - download the C functions for matlab "nurbs_mex_files.tar.gz" from
      http://sourceforge.net/projects/geopdes/files
   - uncompress and untar the file in the folder "nurbs/inst"
   - in Matlab, go to the folder "nurbs/inst" and run the script file 'compile'.
      This will compile the files and save the nurbs package to your Matlab path

 * Install the geopdes_base package:
   - download the latest release of geopdes_base.tar.gz from 
       http://geopdes.sf.net/functions/geopdes_base
   - uncompress and untar the file
   - add the directory "geopdes_base/inst" and its subfolders to
      Matlab's default path (see below)

 * The other packages are installed analogously, but the geopdes_base
    package must be also installed in order to make them work.

 * For convenience, you can set the path using the script "geopdes_setpath.m".
   - download the function from http://sourceforge.net/projects/geopdes/files
   - replace "my_path" by the path of the folder where you saved the packages
   - run the script, typing "geopdes_setpath" in Matlab command window
   
2. GETTING STARTED

2.1. EXAMPLES
 
 * Each package contains a set of simple examples, that can be run with the 
    command <geopdes_package>_examples. For instance, typing at the Octave prompt

    geopdes_base_examples

    will guide you through a set of menus to choose some simple yet useful 
    examples for solving the Poisson problem.

 * The source code and the data files for these examples can be found in the directory
    <geopdes_package>/inst/examples

 * A collection of simple geometries constructed with NURBS can be found 
    in the following directories

     geopdes_base/inst/examples/geometry_files
     geopdes_multipatch/inst/examples/geometry_files

2.2. HELP

 * A detailed documentation for the software is not likely to be published.
    We suggest you to read the paper

      C. de Falco, A. Reali, R. Vazquez. 
      GeoPDES: a research tool for Isogeometric Analysis of PDEs, 
      Advances in Engineering Software, 42(12), 2011
      doi:10.1016/j.advengsoft.2011.06.10

    also available in preprint form as

      Tech. Report, IMATI-CNR, (2010),

    In the paper we give an explanation of the architecture, the design and
    the main features of the code. This paper can be seen as brief user's guide.

 * The format for the geometry files is explained in the files

     geopdes_base/doc/geo_specs_v07.txt
     geopdes_multipatch/doc/geo_specs_mp_v07.txt

   Notice that multipatch geometries will not run correctly outside the 
    geopdes_multipatch package. At the time of this release, multipatch 
    problems have been also implemented in geopdes_maxwell, geopdes_elasticity,
    and geopdes_fluid for Taylor-Hood elements.

3. HOW TO CONTRIBUTE

3.1 CITING GeoPDEs

 * GeoPDEs has been developed as a part of our research, and is funded by 
    our respective institutions. The best way to support us is by citing

      C. de Falco, A. Reali, R. Vazquez. 
      GeoPDES: a research tool for Isogeometric Analysis of PDEs,
