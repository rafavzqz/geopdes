% OP_U_V_TP: assemble the mass matrix M = [m(i,j)], m(i,j) = (mu u_j, v_i), exploiting the tensor product structure.
%
%   mat = op_u_v_tp (spu, spv, msh, coeff);
%   [rows, cols, values] = op_u_v_tp (spu, spv, msh, coeff);
%
% INPUT:
%
%  spu:   object representing the space of trial functions (see sp_bspline_2d)
%  spv:   object representing the space of test functions (see sp_bspline_2d)
%  msh:   object defining the domain partition and the quadrature rule (see msh_2d)
%  coeff: function handle to compute the reaction coefficient
%
% OUTPUT:
%
%  mat:    assembled mass matrix
%  rows:   row indices of the nonzero entries
%  cols:   column indices of the nonzero entries
%  values: values of the nonzero entries
