% OP_F_V_TP: assemble the right-hand side vector r = [r(i)], with  r(i) = (f, v_i), using the tensor product structure.
%
%   rhs = op_f_v_tp (spv, msh, coeff);
%
% INPUT:
%     
%   spv:   class representing the function space (see sp_bspline_2d)
%   msh:   class defining the domain partition and the quadrature rule (see msh_2d)
%   coeff: function handle to compute the source function
%
% OUTPUT:
%
%   rhs: assembled right-hand side
