% MSH_GAUSS_NODES: define nodes and weights for a multi-dimensional tensor-product Gauss quadrature rule.
%
%   rule = msh_gauss_nodes (nnodes)
%
% INPUT:
%
%     nnodes:   number of quadrature nodes along each direction
%
% OUTPUT:
%
%  rule:    cell array containing the nodes and weights of the rule  
%           along each direction (rule{idir}(1,:) are the nodes and 
%           rule{idir}(2,:) the weights)
