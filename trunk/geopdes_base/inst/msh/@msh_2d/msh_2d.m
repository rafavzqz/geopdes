%     msh: object containing the following fields and methods
%
%     FIELD_NAME    (SIZE)                  DESCRIPTION
%     nel           (scalar)                number of elements of the partition
%     nel_dir       (1 x 2 vector)          number of elements in each parametric direction
%     nelcol        (scalar)                number of elements in one "column" of the mesh (actually, nel_dir(2))
%     nqn           (scalar)                number of quadrature nodes per element
%     nqn_dir       (1 x 2 vector)          number of quadrature nodes per element in each parametric direction
%     breaks        (1 x 2 cell-array)      unique(breaks)
%     qn            (1 x 2 cell-array)      quadrature nodes along each direction in parametric domain
%     qw            (1 x 2 cell-array)      quadrature weights along each direction in parametric space
%     boundary      (1 x 4 struct-array)    it contains a one-dimensional 'msh' structure for each edge of the boundary (only when boundary is set to true)
%     der2          (scalar)                an option to say whether the second derivative must also be computed (by default is set to false)
%     map           (function handle)       a copy of the map handle of the geometry structure
%     map_der       (function handle)       a copy of the map_der handle of the geometry structure
%     map_der2      (function handle)       a copy of the map_der2 handle of the geometry structure
%
%     METHOD NAME
%     msh_evaluate_col: computes the parameterization (and its derivatives) of
%                       the quadrature points in one column of the mesh, i.e.,
%                       fixing the element in the first parametric direction.
%     msh_eval_boundary_side: computes the parameterization in one boundary side
%                       of the domain.
