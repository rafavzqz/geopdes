%        spu             (struct)                          space of univariate splines in the first parametric direction
%        spv             (struct)                          space of univariate splines in the second parametric direction
%        spw             (struct)                          space of univariate splines in the third parametric direction
%        ndof            (scalar)                          total number of degrees of freedom
%        ndof_dir        (1 x 3 vector)                    degrees of freedom along each direction (only for tensor product spaces)
%        nsh_max         (scalar)                          maximum number of shape functions per element
%        nsh_dir         (1 x 3 vector)                    maximum number of univariate shape functions per element in each parametric direction
%        connectivity    (nsh_max x msh.nel vector)        indices of basis functions that do not vanish in each element
%        boundary        (1 x 6 struct array)              struct array representing the space of traces of basis functions on each edge
%
%       METHOD_NAME
%       sp_evaluate_col: compute the basis functions in one column of the mesh (that is, fixing the element in the first parametric direction).
%       sp_evaluate_row: compute the basis functions in one row of the mesh (that is, fixing the element in the last parametric direction).
%       sp_eval_boundary_side: evaluate the basis functions in one side of the boundary.
