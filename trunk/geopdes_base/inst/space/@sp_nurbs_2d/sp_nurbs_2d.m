%
%       METHOD_NAME
%       sp_evaluate_col: compute the basis functions in one column of the mesh (that is, fixing the element in the first parametric direction).
%       sp_evaluate_col_param: compute the basis functions in one column of the mesh in the reference domain.
%       sp_eval_boundary_side: evaluate the basis functions in one side of the boundary.
