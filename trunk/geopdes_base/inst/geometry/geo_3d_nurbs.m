% GEO_3D_NURBS: construct a geometry map from a structure of the NURBS toolbox.
%
%   output = geo_3d_nurbs (nurbs, pts, ders)
%
% INPUTS:
%
%   nurbs:  NURBS structure that defines the geometry
%   pts  :  points where the map has to be evaluated
%   ders :  number of derivatives to be evaluated (from 0 to 2)
%
% OUTPUT:
%
%   output: for ders = 0, the parametrization F evaluated at pts
%           for ders = 1, the Jacobian of the parametrization, evaluated at pts
%           for ders = 2, the Hessian of the parametrization, evaluated at pts
