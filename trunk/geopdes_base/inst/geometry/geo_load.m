% GEO_LOAD: create a geometry structure from a file or a cell-array of functions.
%
% geometry = geo_load (input)
%
% INPUT :
%
%   the input variable may be either
%   - a string variable with the name of the file to be read
%   - a cell-array of function handles
%   - a 4x4 matrix representing an affine transformation
%   - a structure representing a nurbs surface or volume
%
% OUTPUT:
%
%   geometry: a structure that contains, at least, the following fields
%             map:     a function handle to evaluate the parameterization
%             map_der: a function handle to evaluate the derivatives of the parameterization
%   The structure may contain further information. See the documentation.
