% TSPLINE_SP_EVAL_MSH: Evaluate a function, given by its degrees of freedom, at the points given by a msh object.
%
%   [eu, F] = tspline_sp_eval_msh (u, space, msh, [option]);
%
% INPUT:
%
%     u:         vector of dof weights
%     space:     structure defining the discrete space (see tspline_space_mesh)
%     msh:       structure defining the points where to evaluate (see tspline_space_mesh)
%     option:    accepted options are 'value' (default) and 'gradient'.
%
% OUTPUT:
%
%     eu: the function evaluated in the given points 
%     F:  grid points in the physical domain
