1 - Install
 
 * Install Octave version 3.2 or higher. Source code is available from http://www.octave.org, 
 binary packages are available from http://octave.sf.net

 * Install the "nurbs", "integration" and "geopdes_base" packages available on http://octave.sf.net and sourceforge.net.

 * Install  geopdes_mpi
    pkg install geopdes_mpi
 
3 - Test

To launch a multiprocess simulation use a command like this

mpirun -np 24  octave -q --eval "test_ring_mixed_bc; n_sub = 5*n_sub; ex_bspline_laplace_2d_mpi"

-np       set the number of processes

-q        suppress the welcome message that would otherwise be printed by each node

--eval    pass the commands to octave, in this case
          
          test_ring_mixed_bc;         load test data and exact solution
          n_sub = 5*n_sub;            since each process need a minimum of few elements change
                                      the number of mesh subdivision accordingly
          ex_bspline_laplace_2d_mpi   launch the example script

note that each test requires a different syntax to change the mesh data.
