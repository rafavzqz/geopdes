%   [spv, spp] = sp_bspline_fluid (elem_name, knots, nsub, ...
%                                               degreep, regularity, msh)
%
% INPUTS:
%
%   elem_name:  the name of the element. Right now 'TH' (Taylor-Hood), 
%                'NDL' (Nedelec, 2nd family), 'RT' (Raviart-Thomas) and
%                'SG' (SubGrid) are supported.
%   knots:      knot vector of the coarse geometry.
%   nsub:       number of subdivisions of each interval.
%   degreep:    degree of the pressure space along each parametric direction
%   regularity: continuity of the pressure space along each parametric direction
%   msh:        msh object containing (in the field msh.qn) the points 
%                along each parametric direction in the parametric 
%                domain at which to evaluate, i.e. quadrature points 
%                or points for visualization (see msh_cartesian).
%
% OUTPUT:
%
%   spv: object representing the discrete velocity function space (see sp_vector, sp_vector_piola_transform)
%   spp: object representing the discrete pressure function space (see sp_bspline, sp_bspline_nforms)
