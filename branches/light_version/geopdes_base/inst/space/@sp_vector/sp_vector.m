% SP_VECTOR: Constructor of the class vectorial spaces with a component-wise mapping.
%
%     sp = sp_vector (scalar_spaces, msh, [transform])
%
% INPUTS:
%
%    scalar_space: array of space objects, one for each component (see sp_scalar)
%    msh:          mesh object that defines the domain partition and the quadrature rule (see msh_cartesian)
%    transform:    string with the transform to the physical domain, one of 
%                   'grad-preserving' (default), 'curl-preserving' and 'div-preserving'.
%
% OUTPUT:
%
%    sp: object representing the discrete function space of vector-valued functions, with the following fields and methods:
%
%        FIELD_NAME      (SIZE)                    DESCRIPTION
%        ncomp           (scalar)                  number of components of the functions of the space
%        scalar_spaces   (1 x ncomp cell array)    array of space objects, one for each component
%        ndof            (scalar)                  total number of degrees of freedom
%        ndof_dir        (ncomp x ndim matrix)     for each component, number of degrees of freedom along each direction
%        comp_dofs       (1 x ncomp cell array)    indices of the degrees of freedom for each component
%        nsh_max         (scalar)                  maximum number of shape functions per element
%        boundary        (1 x 2*ndim struct array) struct array representing the space of traces of basis functions on each edge
%
%       METHOD_NAME
%       sp_evaluate_col: compute the basis functions in one column of the mesh (that is, fixing the element in the first parametric direction).
%       sp_eval_boundary_side: evaluate the basis functions in one side of the boundary.
%       sp_precompute:  compute any of the fields related to the discrete
%                       space (except boundary), in all the quadrature points,
%                       as in the space structure from previous versions.
