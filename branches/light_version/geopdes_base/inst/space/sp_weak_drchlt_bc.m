% SP_WEAK_DRCHLT_BC: compute the matrix and right hand-side to impose
% the Dirichlet boundary conditions in weak form for the tangential
% component. To be used with the 'RT' spaces.
%
% The code computes the following terms in the left hand-side
% 
%  - \int_{Gamma_D} mu*{(\grad u)n \cdot v - (\grad v)n \cdot n + (Cpen /  he) * (u cdot v)}
%
% and in the right hand-side
%
%  - \int_{Gamma_D} mu*{(\grad v)n \cdot g + (Cpen / he) * (v cdot g)}
%
% with u the trial function, v the test function, he the normal characteristic length, 
%  and g the boundary condition to be imposed.
%
%
%   [N_mat, N_rhs] = sp_weak_drchlt_bc (space, msh, bnd_sides, bnd_func, coeff, Cpen)
%
% INPUTS:
%     
%    space:     space object (see sp_vector_div_transform)
%    msh:       mesh object (see msh_cartesian)
%    bnd_sides: boundary sides on which the Dirichlet condition is imposed
%    bnd_func:  the condition to be imposed (g in the equations)
%    coeff:     function handle for the viscosity coefficient (mu in the equation)
%    Cpen:      a penalization term
%   
% OUTPUT:
%
%     N_mat:       the computed matrix, to be added in the left hand-side
%     N_rhs:       the computed right hand-side
