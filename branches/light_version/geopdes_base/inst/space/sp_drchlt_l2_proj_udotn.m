% SP_DRCHLT_L2_PROJ_UDOTN: assign the normal degrees of freedom through an L2 projection. To be used with the 'RT' spaces.
%                           The imposed condition reads   u*n = h*n
%
%   [vel, normal_dofs] = sp_drchlt_l2_proj_udotn (space, msh, bnd_sides, bnd_func)
%
% INPUTS:
%     
%    space:     space object (see sp_vector_div_transform)
%    msh:       mesh object (see msh_cartesian)
%    bnd_sides: boundary sides on which the Dirichlet condition is imposed
%    bnd_func:  the condition to be imposed (g in the equations)
%   
% OUTPUT:
%
%     vel:         assigned value to the normal degrees of freedom
%     normal_dofs: global numbering of the normal basis functions
