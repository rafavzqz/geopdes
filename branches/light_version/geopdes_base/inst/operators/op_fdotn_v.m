% OP_FDOTN_V: assemble the vector r = [r(i)], with  r(i) = (f * n, v), with n the normal exterior vector.
%  v should be a scalar-valued function.
%
%   rhs = op_fdotn_v (spv, msh, coeff);
%
% INPUT:
%     
%   spv:   structure representing the function space (see sp_vector_div_transform/sp_eval_boundary_side)
%   msh:   structure containing the domain partition and the quadrature rule (see msh_cartesian/msh_eval_boundary_side)
%   coeff: source function evaluated at the quadrature points
%
% OUTPUT:
%
%   rhs: assembled right-hand side
