% MSH_SET_QUAD_NODES: compute location and weights of quadrature nodes in a tensor product grid.
%
%  [qn, qw] = msh_set_quad_nodes (breaks, rule)
%  [qn, qw] = msh_set_quad_nodes (breaks, rule, limits)
%
% INPUT:
%     
%  breaks:  breaks along each direction (in parametric space)
%  rule:    cell array containing the nodes and weights of the rule to be 
%           used in each direction (rule{idir}(1,:) are the nodes and rule{idir}(2,:) the weights)
%  limits:  (optional) limits of the interval in which the quadrature rule 
%            was defined. By default it is [-1 1].
%
% OUTPUT:
%
%   qn: {qnu, [qnv, [qnw]]}  quadrature nodes
%   qw: {qwu, [qwv, [qww]]}  quadrature weights
