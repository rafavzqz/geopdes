% MSH_BOUNDARY_SIDE_FROM_INTERIOR: create a mesh object with quadrature points on one boundary side, 
%    but taking into account the information from the interior. This is necessary when imposing 
%    Dirichlet conditions in a weak form, or to compute normal derivatives, for instance.
%
%     msh_side = msh_boundary_side_from_interior (msh, iside);
%
% INPUTS:
%     
%    msh:   mesh object (see msh_cartesian)
%    iside: number of the boundary side to compute, from 1 to 2*msh.ndim (see the file geo_specs for documentation about face numbering)
%
% OUTPUT:
%
%     msh_side: mesh object, with quadrature points only on the chosen side (see msh_cartesian)
