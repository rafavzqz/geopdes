% MP_GEO_LOAD: create a multipatch geometry structure and the interfaces structure from a file.
%
% [geometry, boundaries, interfaces] = mp_geo_load (input)
%
% INPUT :
%
%   input: a string variable with the name of the file to be read
%
% OUTPUT:
%
%   geometry:   an array of structures that contain the following fields
%               map:     a function handle to evaluate the parametrization
%               map_der: a function handle to evaluate the derivatives of the parametrization
%               nurbs:   a structure compatible with the NURBS toolbox
%
%   boundaries: an array of structures that contain the following fields
%               nsides:  number of faces conforming each boundary
%               patches: patches to which these faces belong
%               faces:   local numbering of the faces in their patch
%
%   interfaces: an array of structures that contain the following fields
%      2D Case
%               ref:    reference number of each interface
%               patch1: the index of the first coinciding patch, and the index of its interface boundary edge
%               patch2: the index of the second coinciding patch, and the index of its interface boundary edge
%               ornt:   a flag telling if the direction on patch1 matches the direction on patch2
%      3D Case
%               ref:    reference number of each interface
%               patch1: the index of the first coinciding patch, and the index of its interface boundary face
%               patch2: the index of the second coinciding patch, and the index of its interface boundary face
%               flag:   a flag telling if the u- and v- parameter directions on the first face coincide with the u- and v- directions on the second face
%               ornt1:  a flag telling if the u- direction on the first face matches the direction on patch2
%               ornt2:  a flag telling if the v- direction on the first face matches the direction on patch2
%
%   subdomains: an array of structures that contains the following fields
%               name:    the name of the subdomain
%               patches: indices of the patches belonging to the subdomain
