% SP_HCURL_ERROR: Evaluate the error in H(curl) norm.
%
%   [errhcurl, errl2, errcurl] = sp_hcurl_error (space, msh, u, uex, curluex);
%
% INPUT:
%
%    space:   object defining the space of discrete functions (see sp_vector_curl_transform)
%    msh:     object defining the domain partition and the quadrature rule (see msh_cartesian)
%    u:       vector of dof weights
%    uex:     function handle to evaluate the exact solution
%    curluex: function handle to evaluate the curl of the exact solution
%
% OUTPUT:
%
%     errhcurl: error in H(curl) norm
%     errl2:    error in L^2 norm
%     errcurl:  error of the curl in L^2 norm
