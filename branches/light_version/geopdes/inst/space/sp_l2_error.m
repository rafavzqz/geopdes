% SP_L2_ERROR: Evaluate the error in L^2 norm.
%
%   [errl2, errl2_elem] = sp_l2_error (space, msh, u, uex);
%
% INPUT:
%
%     space:    structure representing the space of discrete functions (see sp_bspline_3d_phys)
%     msh:      structure containing the domain partition and the quadrature rule (see msh_push_forward_2d)
%     u:        vector of dof weights
%     uex:      function handle to evaluate the exact solution
%
% OUTPUT:
%
%     errl2:  error in L^2 norm
%     errl2_elem:  error in L^2 norm, for each single element
