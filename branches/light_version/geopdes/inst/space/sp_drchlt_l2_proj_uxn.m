% SP_DRCHLT_L2_PROJ_UXN: assign the degrees of freedom of Dirichlet boundaries through an L2 projection.
%                           The imposed condition reads   uxn = h
%
%   [u, dofs] = sp_drchlt_l2_proj_uxn (sp, msh, h, sides)
%
% INPUT:
%
%  sp:    class defining the space of discrete functions (see sp_vector_curl_transform)
%  msh:   class defining the domain partition and the quadrature rule (see msh_cartesian)
%  h:     function handle to compute the Dirichlet condition
%  sides: boundary sides on which a Dirichlet condition is imposed
%
% OUTPUT:
%
%  u:    assigned value to the degrees of freedom
%  dofs: global numbering of the corresponding basis functions
