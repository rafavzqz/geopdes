% OP_DIV_V_Q_TP: assemble the matrix B = [b(i,j)], b(i,j) = (q_i, div v_j), exploiting the tensor product structure.
%
%   mat = op_div_v_q_tp (spv, spq, msh);
%   [rows, cols, values] = op_div_v_q_tp (spv, spq, msh);
%
% INPUT: 
%
%   spv:     object representing the space of trial functions for the velocity (see sp_vector, sp_vector_div_transform)
%   spq:     object representing the space of test functions for the pressure (see sp_bspline)
%   msh:     object that defines the domain partition and the quadrature rule (see msh_cartesian)
%
% OUTPUT: 
%
%   mat:    assembled matrix 
%   rows:   row indices of the nonzero entries
%   cols:   column indices of the nonzero entries
%   values: values of the nonzero entries
