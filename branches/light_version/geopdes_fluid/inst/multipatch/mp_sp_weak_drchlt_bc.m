% MP_SP_WEAK_DRCHLT_BC: compute the matrix and right hand-side to impose
%  the Dirichlet boundary conditions in weak form for the tangential
%  component. To be used with the 'RT' and 'NDL' spaces.
%
% The code computes the following terms in the left hand-side
% 
%  - \int_{Gamma_D} mu*{(\grad u)n \cdot v - (\grad v)n \cdot n + (Cpen /  he) * (u cdot v)}
%
% and in the right hand-side
%
%  - \int_{Gamma_D} mu*{(\grad v)n \cdot g + (Cpen / he) * (v cdot g)}
%
% with u the trial function, v the test function, he the normal characteristic length, 
%  and g the boundary condition to be imposed.
%
%
%   [N_mat, N_rhs] = mp_sp_weak_drchlt_bc  (space, msh, gnum, ornt, boundaries, refs, bnd_func, coeff, Cpen)
%
% INPUTS:
%
%  space:      space object (see sp_vector_div_transform)
%  msh:        mesh object (see msh_cartesian)
%  gnum:       global numbering of the degrees of freedom (see mp_interface_hdiv)
%  ornt:       global orientation of the degrees of freedom (see mp_interface_hdiv)
%  boundaries: array of structures containing the information for the boundaries (see mp_geo_load)
%  refs:       boundary sides on which the Dirichlet condition is imposed
%  bnd_func:   the condition to be imposed (g in the equations)
%  coeff:      function handle for the viscosity coefficient (mu in the equation)
%  Cpen:       a penalization term
%   
% OUTPUT:
%
%   N_mat:     the computed matrix, to be added in the left hand-side
%   N_rhs:     the computed right hand-side
