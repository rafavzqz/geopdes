% SP_EVAL_BOUNDARY_SIDE: Construct the space structure of one side of the boundary.
%
%     sp_side = sp_eval_boundary_side (sp, msh_side)
%
% INPUTS:
%
%     sp:       space object (see sp_vector)
%     msh_side: mesh structure containing the information of the quadrature
%               rule on the boundary edge (see msh_cartesian/msh_eval_boundary_side)
%
% OUTPUT:
%
%     sp_side: structure that contains the following fields

%     connectivity    (nsh_max x msh_side.nel vector)                 indices of basis functions that do not vanish in each element
%     shape_functions (ncomp x msh_side.nqn x nsh_max x msh_side.nel) basis functions evaluated at each quadrature node in each element
