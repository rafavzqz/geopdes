<h1>Description</h1>
	
<p><strong>GeoPDEs</strong> is an <strong>open source and free</strong> package for the research and teaching of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isogeometric_analysis"><strong>Isogeometric Analysis</strong></a>, written in <strong>Octave</strong> and fully compatible with <strong>Matlab</strong>.</p>

<p>The GeoPDEs package provides a common and flexible framework for implementing and testing new isogeometric methods for the solution of partial differential equations. You can run through the long list of existing <a href="{{ site.github.url }}/download/#examples"><strong>examples</strong></a> to learn more about the package.</p>

<h1>Features</h1>

<p>These are some of the main features of GeoPDEs:</p>

<ul>
<li>Dimension independent implementation: the same code is valid for curves, surfaces and volumes.</li>
<li>Implementation of multipatch domains, with conforming interfaces.</li>
<li>Div- and curl-conforming spline spaces, also in multipatch domains.</li>
<li>Examples for Poisson, linear elasticity, advection-diffusion, bilaplacian, Stokes and Maxwell equations.</li>
<li>Detailed documentation, accessible with the <em>help</em> command.</li>
</ul>
