**GeoPDEs** is an **open source and free** package for the research and teaching of [**Isogeometric Analysis**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isogeometric_analysis), written in **Octave** and fully compatible with **Matlab**.

The GeoPDEs package provides a common and flexible framework for implementing and testing new isogeometric methods for the solution of partial differential equations. You can run through the long list of existing [**examples**](../download/#examples) to learn more about the package.

# Features

These are some of the main features of GeoPDEs: 

* Dimension independent implementation: the same code is valid for curves, surfaces and volumes.
* Implementation of multipatch domains, with conforming interfaces.
* Div- and curl-conforming spline spaces, also in multipatch domains.
* Examples for Poisson, linear elasticity, advection-diffusion, bilaplacian, Stokes, Navier-Stokes, Maxwell and Kirchhoff-Love shells.
* Adaptive methods with hierarchical B-splines.
* Detailed documentation, accessible with the _help_ command.
