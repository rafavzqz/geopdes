% SOLVE_KIRCHHOFF_LOVE_SHELL: Solve the Kirchhoff-Love shell model in a NURBS domain.
%
% USAGE:
%
%  [geometry, msh, space, u] = solve_kirchhoff_love_shell (problem_data, method_data)
%
% INPUT:
%
%  problem_data: a structure with data of the problem. It contains the fields:
%    - geo_name:     name of the file containing the geometry
%    - drchlt_sides: sides with Dirichlet boundary condition
%    - drchlt_components: cell-array, the components that are set to zero for each drchlt_side
%    - E_coeff:      function handle for Young's modulus
%    - nu_coeff:     function handle for Poisson's ratio
%    - thickness:    scalar value, thickness of the shell
%    - f:            source term, distributed load
%
%  method_data : a structure with discretization data. Its fields are:
%    - degree:     degree (>=2) of the spline functions.
%    - regularity: continuity (>=1) of the spline functions.
%    - nsub:       number of subelements with respect to the geometry mesh 
%                   (nsub=1 leaves the mesh unchanged)
%    - nquad:      number of points for Gaussian quadrature rule
%
% OUTPUT:
%
%  geometry: geometry structure (see geo_load)
%  msh:      mesh object that defines the quadrature rule (see msh_cartesian)
%  space:    space object that defines the discrete basis functions (see sp_vector)
%  u:        the computed degrees of freedom
%
% NOTE: only homogeneous Dirichlet conditions implemented so far
%
% See also EX_KL_SHELL_SCORDELIS_LO_ROOF for an example.
