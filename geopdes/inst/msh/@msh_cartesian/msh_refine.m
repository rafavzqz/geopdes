% MSH_REFINE: construct a refined mesh from a given one. The function only
%                refines the mesh, it does not refine any space.
%
%     msh_fine = msh_refine (msh, nsub);
%
% INPUTS:
%     
%     msh:  an object of the msh_cartesian class (see msh_cartesian)
%     nsub: number of uniform subdivisions to apply on the elements, and for each direction
%   
% OUTPUT:
%
%     msh_fine: an object of the class msh_cartesian (see msh_cartesian)
