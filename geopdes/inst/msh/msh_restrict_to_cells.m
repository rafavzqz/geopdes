% MSH_RESTRICT_TO_CELLS: restrict a msh struct to a subset of its elements
%  in elem_list.
%
% This function is useful for the current version of hierarchical splines. 
% The function allows to avoid recomputing the parametrization, which is
%  the most expensive part in the current version of hierarchical splines.
%
%     msh_elems = msh_restrict_to_cells (msh, elem_list)
%
% INPUTS:
%
%    msh:       mesh struct, computed with msh_cartesian/msh_evaluate_col(element_list)
%    elem_list: numbering of the elements, a subset of msh.elem_list.
%
% OUTPU3
%     msh_elems: structure containing the quadrature rule in the given elements of the physical domain, which contains the following fields
%
%     FIELD_NAME         (SIZE)                  DESCRIPTION
%     ndim               (scalar)                dimension of the parametric space
%     rdim               (scalar)                dimension of the physical space
%     nel                (scalar)                number of elements in the sublist
%     elem_list          (1 x nel)               numbering of the elements in the sublist
%     nqn                (scalar)                number of quadrature points per element (must be the same for every patch)
%     nqn_dir            (1 x ndim)              number of quadrature points in each direction (must be the same for every patch)
%     quad_weights, geo_map, geo_map_jac, geo_map_der2, geo_map_der3, geo_map_der4, jacdet, element_size (see msh_evaluate_col for details)
