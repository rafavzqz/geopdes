% MP_GEO_LOAD: create a multipatch geometry structure and the interfaces structure from a file.
%
% [geometry, boundaries, interfaces, subdomains, boundary_interfaces] = mp_geo_load (input)
%
% INPUT :
%
%   The input variable may be either
%   - an array of NURBS structures representing a nurbs geometry, as in the NURBS toolbox
%   - a string variable with the name of the file to be read (see doc/geo_specs_mp_v21.txt)
%
%   In the second case, the information is automatically generated with the function
%    nrbmultipatch. It is recommended to check that all the information is correct.
%
% OUTPUT:
%
%   geometry:   an array of structures that contain the following fields
%               map:     a function handle to evaluate the parametrization
%               map_der: a function handle to evaluate the derivatives of the parametrization
%               map_der2: a function handle to evaluate the second derivatives of the parametrization
%               map_der3: a function handle to evaluate the third derivatives of the parametrization
%               map_der4: a function handle to evaluate the fourth derivatives of the parametrization
%               nurbs:   a structure compatible with the NURBS toolbox
%
%   boundaries: an array of structures that contain the following fields
%               nsides:  number of faces conforming each boundary
%               patches: patches to which these faces belong
%               faces:   local numbering of the faces in their patch
%
%   interfaces: an array of structures that contain the following fields
%
%               patch1: the index of the first coinciding patch, 
%               side1:  the local index in patch1 of the interface boundary vertex (1D), edge (2D) or face (3D)
%               patch2: the index of the second coinciding patch
%               side2:  the local index in patch2 of the interface boundary vertex (1D), edge (2D) or face (3D)
%      2D Case
%               ornt:          a flag telling if the direction on patch1 matches the direction on patch2
%      3D Case
%               flag:          a flag telling if the u- and v- parameter directions on the first face coincide 
%                                   with the u- and v- directions on the second face
%               ornt1:         a flag telling if the u- direction on the first face matches the direction on patch2
%               ornt2:         a flag telling if the v- direction on the first face matches the direction on patch2
%
%   subdomains: an array of structures that contains the following fields
%               name:    the name of the subdomain
%               patches: indices of the patches belonging to the subdomain
%
%   boundary_interfaces: similar to interfaces, but for the (n-1) dimensional boundary
