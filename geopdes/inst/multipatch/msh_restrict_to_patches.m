% MSH_RESTRICT_TO_PATCHES: restrict a struct, computed for a given list of
%   elements, to the elements that only belong to a certain list of patches.
%
% This function is useful for the current version of hierarchical splines, 
%  in particular for boundary conditions, since only some patches need to
%  be computed.
% The function allows to avoid recomputing the parametrization, which is
%  the most expensive part in the current version of hierarchical splines.
%
%     msh_elems = msh_restrict_to_patches (msh, patch_list)
%
% INPUTS:
%
%    msh:        mesh struct, computed with msh_multipatch/msh_evaluate_element_list
%    patch_list: numbering of the elements where the evaluations are performed.
%
% OUTPUT:
%
%     msh_elems: structure containing the quadrature rule in the given elements of the physical domain, which contains the following fields
%
