%     nel                (scalar)                number of elements in the list
%     elem_list          (1 x nel)               numbering of the elements in the list
%     nqn                (scalar)                number of quadrature points per element (must be the same for every patch)
%     nqn_dir            (1 x ndim)              number of quadrature points in each direction (must be the same for every patch)
%     nel_per_patch      (1 x npatch)            number of selected elements on each patch
%     der2               (scalar)                wether second derivatives must be computed
%     der3               (scalar)                wether third derivatives must be computed
%     der4               (scalar)                wether fourth derivatives must be computed
%     elem_list_of_patch (1 x npatch cell-array) selected elements on the patch, with local numbering
%     nel_dir_of_patch   (1 x npatch cell-array) the total number of elements in each direction, for each patch
%     quad_weights, geo_map, geo_map_jac, geo_map_der2, geo_map_der3, geo_map_der4, jacdet, element_size (see msh_evaluate_col for details)
%
% The function only works if the number of quadrature points is the same for all the patches and all directions.
