Summary of important changes for geopdes-3.0.0:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 In this version we clearly separate functions that work on structures (as in version 1), and those that work on tensor-product classes (As in version 2).

* Added new classes msh_multipatch and sp_multipatch.
* Moved sp_eval, sp_to_vtk into the space classes.
* Moved sp_*_error into the classes, and maintain out of the class the same functions from version 1.
* Added the functions sp_*_transform, that work on structures.
* Moved the operators op_*_tp into the corresponding classes.
* Generated the operators op_*_mp, for multipatch domains.
* Added functions sp_get_(cells, neighbors, basis_functions).
* Combine the five old packages into a single one.

Summary of important changes for geopdes_***-2.1.0 (not officially released):
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Added msh_cartesian to replace the old msh_2d and msh_3d.
* Added sp_bspline and sp_nurbs to replace the old classes for spaces.
* Replaced the solve_*d files with a dimension-independent version.
