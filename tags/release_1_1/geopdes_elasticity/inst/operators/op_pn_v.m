% OP_PN_V: assemble the right-hand side vector R = [r(i)], with  r(i) = (p n, v_i), where n is the normal vector.
%
%   mat = op_pn_v (spv, msh, press);
%
% INPUT:
%     
%   spv:   structure representing the function space (see sp_bspline_2d_phys)
%   msh:   structure containing the domain partition and the quadrature rule (see msh_push_forward_2d)
%   press: function evaluated at the quadrature points
%
% OUTPUT:
%
%   mat: assembled right-hand side
