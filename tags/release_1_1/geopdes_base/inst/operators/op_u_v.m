% INPUT:
%   
%  spu:   structure representing the space of trial functions (see sp_bspline_2d_phys)

%  coeff: reaction coefficient
%
% OUTPUT:
%
%  mat:    assembled mass matrix
%  rows:   row indices of the nonzero entries
%  cols:   column indices of the nonzero entries
%  values: values of the nonzero entries
