% MSH_SET_BREAKS: Construct the breaks for the quadrature rule, depending on the choice of the discrete space.
%
% [breaks, der2] = msh_set_breaks (elem_name, knots, nsub)
%
% INPUTS:
%
%   elem_name:    the type of element. Available choices are 'TH' (Taylor-Hood),
%                  'NDL' (Nedelec, 2nd family), 'RT' (Raviart-Thomas) and 
%                  'SG' (subgrid). For more details see the references below
%   knots:        knot vector of the coarse geometry
%   nsub:         number of subdivisions for refinement of the pressure space.
%
% OUTPUT:
%
%   breaks:     interval breaks for the quadrature rule. 
%   der2:       option to know whether the second derivative of the
%                parameterization must be computed or not
