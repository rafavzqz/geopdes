%        ndof            (scalar)                          total number of degrees of freedom
%        ndof_dir        (1 x ndim vector)                 degrees of freedom along each direction (only for tensor product spaces)
%        nsh_max         (scalar)                          maximum number of shape functions per element
%        nsh_dir         (1 x ndim vector)                 maximum number of univariate shape functions per element in each parametric direction
%        boundary        (1 x 2*ndim struct array)         struct array representing the space of traces of basis functions on each edge
%
%       METHOD_NAME
%       sp_evaluate_col: compute the basis functions (and derivatives) in one column of the mesh (that is, fixing the element in the first parametric direction).
%       sp_evaluate_col_param: compute the basis functions (and derivatives) in one column of the mesh in the reference domain.
%       sp_eval_boundary_side: evaluate the basis functions in one side of the boundary.
%       sp_precompute:  compute any of the fields related to the discrete
%                       space (except boundary), in all the quadrature points,
%                       as in the space structure from previous versions.
