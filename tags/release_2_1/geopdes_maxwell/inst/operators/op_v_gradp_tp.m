% OP_V_GRADP_TP: assemble the matrix B = [b(i,j)], b(i,j) = (epsilon grad p_i, v_j), exploiting the tensor product structure.
%
%   mat = op_v_gradp_tp (spv, spp, msh, epsilon);
%   [rows, cols, values] = op_v_gradp_tp (spv, spp, msh, epsilon);
%
% INPUT:
%
%   spv:     object that defines the space of trial functions (see sp_vector_curl_transform)
%   spp:     object that defines the space of the multiplier (see sp_bspline)
%   msh:     object that defines the domain partition and the quadrature rule (see msh_cartesian)
%   epsilon: function handle to compute some physical coefficient
%
% OUTPUT:
%
%   mat:    assembled stiffness matrix
%   rows:   row indices of the nonzero entries
%   cols:   column indices of the nonzero entries
%   values: values of the nonzero entries
